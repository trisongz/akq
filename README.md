# akq

Job queues in python with asyncio and KeyDB/redis.

This fork replaces `redis` with `aiokeydb` and includes `arq-prometheus` as a module.

Minor semantic changes include any reference to `redis` being replaced with `keydb`

See [documentation](https://arq-docs.helpmanual.io/) for more details.
